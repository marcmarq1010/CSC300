public class Pet
{

}

/*
	This class has a static List variable of type Pet named pets that is instantiated as an ArrayList. 
	This class has the following private instance variables:
	String name
	String animal
	String breed
	String color
	double price
	Each instance variable has a simple mutator and accessor.
	There is a default constructor that does nothing.
	There is a second constructor with parameters for each of the five instance variables.
		It calls the mutator for each parameter in order to set the corresponding instance variable.
	There is a toString method that prints out a line like this:
	Max: a black poodle dog purchased for $540.50
	There is an equals method that returns true if the item being compared with is also a Pet and if the animal and breed are the same.
