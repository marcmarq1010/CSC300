/*
	This program can all be done in main
	Create a Scanner to read from the keyboard.
	
	Create a lambda function called reverse that implements GenericInterface
	This lambda accepts a variable of type String and reverses all the characters of the parameter.  It returns the reversed String.
	Then do three times
		Request an input String.
	Use reverse to reverse the String and print out the original String and the reversed String (see Sample IO below).
	
	Create a lambda function called factorial that implements GenericInterface
	This lambda accepts a variable of type int and calculates itâ€™s factorial value. It returns the int value. (Note: Autoboxing will take place automatically or you can use Integer in place of int if you like
	Then do three times
		Request an input integer.
	 	Use factorial to calculate the factorial value and print out the original number and 	factorial (see Sample IO below).
	
	Sample Input/Output
	Enter a string to be reversed:
	abcde
	The entry abcde reversed is edcba
	Enter a string to be reversed:
	My Day Is Great 100%
	The entry My Day Is Great 100% reversed is %001 taerG sI yaD yM
	Enter a string to be reversed:
	39-87-Grand
	The entry 39-87-Grand reversed is dnarG-78-93
	Enter an  integer to be factorialised:
	4
	factorial of 4 = 24
	Enter an  integer to be factorialised:
	6
	factorial of 6 = 720
	Enter an  integer to be factorialised:
	9
	factorial of 9 = 362,880
